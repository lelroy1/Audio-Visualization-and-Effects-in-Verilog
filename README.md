# Audio-Visualization-and-Effects-in-Verilog
The goal of this project was to learn how to make realtime audio modification and visualization in verilog. To do this I decided to create two systems. The first was 2 basic forms of distortion on input audio signals. Simple distortion and Fuzz. After this I decided to create some basic visualization of the waveforms to see the effect of the distortions on the waveform. This was done with some complicated accumulation algorithm and VGA buffering. To learn more about the specifics find project description pdf in the repository.
