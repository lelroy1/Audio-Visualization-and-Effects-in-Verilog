# Audio-Visualization-and-Effects-in-Verilog
The goal of this project was to learn how to make realtime audio modification and visualization in verilog. To do this I decided to create two independent systems. The first was basic forms of distortion on input audio signals. The input audio came from a DE1_SoC FPGA which would also do the 2 different distortions: simple distortion and fuzz. The second system was to create some basic visualization of the waveforms to see the effect of the distortions on the waveform. This was done with a accumulation algorithm and VGA buffering. To learn more about the specifics see project description pdf in the repository.
